# Header

Here you can find the technical documentation for header.
In the next sections, the paths to the files essential for navigation are listed and explained a little.

- The fluid templates can be found at the following location:

```
Resources/Private/Partials/Page/Header.html
```
- Afterwards, you will find several partials in the **Header.html** for executing further fluid templates.

  Define relative path back to source file, for example:

```
Resources/Private/Partials/Page/Header-Image.html
```

```
Resources/Private/Partials/Page/Header.Mainnav.html
```

```
Resources/Private/Partials/Page/Header.Search.html
```

All these files are in rellation to the **Header.html**.

**To learn more about Fluid and TypoScript we refer to the TYPO3 documentation. It is important to use the correct documentation for the given TYPO3 version.**
